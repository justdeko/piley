## About piley

piley is a small To-Do app that uses piles to manage your tasks. You can stack up tasks within a
pile, create and manage your piles and also set reminders and recurring tasks. If you set up a
server, you can also back up your tasks and sync regularly to get the newest state.

* [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection

* [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) and [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for
  remote calls

  and Compose navigation

## Getting Started

To start using piley, you can just get the apk from the
**[Releases](https://github.com/justdeko/piley/releases)** section.

However, this will not
have any remote functionality and you will have to use offline mode (just check the offline mode
checkbox when registering).
The API url is by default `10.0.2.2`, which is used in emulators to connect to the localhost
environment of the emulator host.

### Connect to piley-server

If you want to connect your app to a self-hosted piley-server backend to upload backups, you need to
run the `build-with-custom-url.sh`script which will result in a debug apk with the target URL you
entered. The URL should have a valid SSL certificate.

If you also want to build a release apk with your custom url or use an endpoint with a self-signed
SSL certificate, you will have to manually change the
network security config and include your certificate in `trust-anchors`. Then build the release apk
as usual using Android Studio or the CLI.
